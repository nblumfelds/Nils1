		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>&#160&#160I am a student currently studying L3 BTEC Extended Diploma in Engineering at Darlington College. I've also done a L2 Manufacturing course which helped me to secure an industrial placement with a local metal fabrication company called Readman Fabrications.</p> <br> 
		<p>&#160&#160I've been working part-time for just over 2 years now. The first major task I was given was to build a pair of gates for the Crook Town AFC football grounds. Since then I've have done steel fabrication like making fences, modifying containers, steel structures (e.g. mezzanine floors), maintenace work in a quarry and more.</p> <br>

		<p>&#160&#160I like to get hands on with stuff, but I'm also a geek in the theory side of engineering. One of the most exciting events happening right now, in my eyes, is the construction of the ITER nuclear fusion plant which, if successful, is the "holy grail" of energy sources.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160I havent done any kind of programming or, more specifically, text formating before so its a good feeling now that I can make a simple .html page. I still need to work on it, for example the built in messeger dosent work.</p>
		<p>&#160&#160I like to learn and do new things, I find learning enjoyable as well as valuable and crucial to self and others development.</p>
